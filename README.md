### Installing packages
The easiest way to install python packages is to use either pip or conda.
Conda includes many data science libraries such as pandas, numpy, scipy or scikit-learn.
 Also it includes some deep learning libraries such as pytorch.

Installing tensorflow:
https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/tasks/tensorflow/

If you want to create an anaconda environment then you would need to install the libraries yourself.
